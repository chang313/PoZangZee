# DP6. Hi-fi Prototyping

------

### POV

1. When similar emails have to be sent to many different people with little amendments, heavy email users tend to make a format on an external text editors.
2. Heavy email users make mistakes. They sometimes miss an important email, or manage to bring it into attention, but forget to send a reply.
3. For heavy email users, email is an integral part of their job. They need to organize the email as tasks faster.
