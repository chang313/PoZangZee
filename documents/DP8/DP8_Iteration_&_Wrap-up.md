# DP8. Iteration & Wrap-up

## Final Interface

#### Representative screenshots

screenshots + show uniqueness using callouts, annotations, captions

#### Quality arguments

Make convincing arguments for what makes your interface "great". Add comments from users, UI screenshots, etc. that could support your arguments. Depending on your interface, you may focus on different aspects: neat features, visual design, usability, novel UI components you designed, hardcore implementation, etc. This is your chance to convince us that what you created is a high quality user interface. **700 words max**

* 일단 현존하는 이메일 시스템 들에 도전함. (brave) 이메일 자체를 구현했음 (lots of work)
* 
* simplicity of the design > very easy to learn, effective
* pinned&pin it > star 이나 tag 는 있지만 자동으로 sorting 해주는, 보내고 나면 unpin 해주는 이메일 정렬 시스템은 처음이다. 단순하지만 간편하게 사용 가능
* format saving function 은 현존하는 이메일 시스템중 하나도 없다. 다양한 사람들에게 비슷한 이메일을 보내는 사람에게는 굉장히 간편할듯
* ctrl+enter 정도의 단축키는 있어도, 이렇게 다양한 단축키를 지원하는 이메일 시스템은 드물다. target user 이 email users with frequent and diverse email uses 인 만큼 expert 를 타겟팅하고있어 시간 단축에 굉장히 효율적일 것이라고 생각
* 로고가 귀엽다

## Iteration

Through the DP7: user testing process, we found two major problems in our interface - minor bugs and affordance problems. We spent the DP8 time to fix the problems we stated during DP7 and tested an extra user to see if the problem was fixed.

For minor bugs, we tried to make our interface as complete as we can. To avoid the frustration we had during the DP7 user testing, we found as many bugs as possible, and was able to fix most of them. Some of the bugs included no format showing when *Format* button was clicked, shortcut keys working on the background while writing a new email, invalid emails showing up for no reason, and the highlighting malfunctioning sometimes.

For affordance problems, where were two major issues we noticed. The first problem was that the shortcut key instruction button was not easily seen. To fix the problem, we changed the shape and the color (changed from coral to white) and included a keyboard icon so that the user can easily find the instruction during the task. As a result, another user we tested had no problem finding the button. The second problem was how the keyboard shortcut was displayed. For example, some users thought to go back, they had to press left arrow, backspace, and esc **at the same time**. We included a slash in between to make the instructions more easily understood.
